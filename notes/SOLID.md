# SOLID Principles in Java üöÄ

## üîπ S ‚Äî Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**Definition:**
> A class should have one and only one reason to change.

This means every class should focus on a **single job** or **responsibility**. Mixing multiple roles makes a class hard to maintain, test, and scale.

---

### ‚ùå Violating SRP

```java
public class Invoice {
    public void calculateTotal() {
        // Calculate the invoice total
    }

    public void printInvoice() {
        // Print the invoice
    }

    public void saveToDatabase() {
        // Save to DB
    }
}

Problem:
The class is doing:
	‚Ä¢	Business logic (calculateTotal)
	‚Ä¢	Presentation logic (printInvoice)
	‚Ä¢	Persistence (saveToDatabase)

If printing logic changes, the class must change ‚Äî even though it has nothing to do with calculation or DB.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Following SRP

public class Invoice {
    public void calculateTotal() {
        // Calculate the invoice total
    }
}

public class InvoicePrinter {
    public void print(Invoice invoice) {
        // Print the invoice
    }
}

public class InvoiceRepository {
    public void save(Invoice invoice) {
        // Save to DB
    }
}

Benefit:
Each class now has only one reason to change:
	‚Ä¢	Business rule change ‚Üí Invoice
	‚Ä¢	Printing format ‚Üí InvoicePrinter
	‚Ä¢	DB logic ‚Üí InvoiceRepository

‚∏ª

üìå Key Takeaway:

Keep your classes focused.
If it feels like a class is ‚Äúdoing too much,‚Äù it probably is.
