 * Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/
 * Status: Solved âœ…
 * Time: O(n), Space: O(n)
 * Approach:
 *   1. Initialize all children with 1 candy.
 *   2. Traverse left to right: if the current child has a higher rating than the previous one,
 *      give one more candy than the previous.
 *   3. Traverse right to left: if the current child has a higher rating than the next one,
 *      ensure they have more candies than the next (without reducing any previous assignments).
 *   4. Sum up the candies array to get the total minimum required.
